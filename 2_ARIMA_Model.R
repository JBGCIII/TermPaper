# We now want to "identify, estimate and do diagnostics of at least one ARIMA-model". We know 
# from the tests above that we want to estimate an ARIMA(p,1,q) for some p and q, i.e. an 
# ARMA(p,q) model for the difference of the real M1 money stock.

# Plotting the estimated autocorrelation function

Acf(dm)

# An ARMA(1,1) or MA(1) seems like good candidates (why?). Let's first use the arima() function
# to estimate and check coefficients.

MA1 <- arima(dm, order = c(0,0,1), method = "ML")
ARMA11 <- arima(dm, order = c(1,0,1), method = "ML")

# Ljung-Box test

# Let's start by plotting the residuals and check the ACF of both models

par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # to plot the four plots below in a 2 x 2 grid
plot(MA1$residuals,
     main = "MA(1) Residual",
     ylab = "Residual",

abline(h = mean(MA1$residuals),
       lty = "dashed",
       lwd = 2,

# It is not unexpected that these plots look similar for both series (why?) but both look 
# good!

# We now perform Ljung-Box tests. First we compute the appropriate number of lags to choose 
# using the the usual rule of thumb.

q <- floor(0.75*nobs(MA1)^(1/3)) # = 4

# Then compute the number of parameters for our two models.

ncoeff_MA1 <- length(coef(MA1)) # = 2
ncoeff_ARMA11 <- length(coef(ARMA11)) # = 3

# Then use the LjungBox function to perform the LjungBox test. Remember that the null 
# hypothesis of the Ljung-Box test is autocorrelation = 0 for lags 1,...,q.

LjungBox(MA1$residuals, lags = q, fitdf = ncoeff_MA1)
LjungBox(ARMA11$residuals, lags = q, fitdf = ncoeff_ARMA11)

# Can not reject the null in both cases which does not surprise me given the plot.

# Finally we want to rank our two models using AIC and BIC (Bayesian information
# criterion). Recall that:

# AIC: 2k - 2log(L),
# BIC: log(n)k - 2log(L),

# and remember that lower is better!

IC <- data.frame(
  Model = c("MA(1)", "ARMA(1,1)"),
  AIC = c(AIC(MA1), AIC(ARMA11)),
  BIC = c(BIC(MA1), BIC(ARMA11))
